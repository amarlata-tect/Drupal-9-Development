## About the Course
Drupal is one of the most popular web content management systems on the planet and offers an incredible array of features and functionality. Small non-profits and businesses to multi-billion dollar multinational companies are all using Drupal as the core of their presence on the web. 
This course will take you step by step through the process of first creating a module. You will also learn to use the Views module (now part of core!) and other contributed modules to add a bit of customization to the site.
With the “code-free” elements in place, you will take your skills to the next level and begin to develop custom modules that alter the existing functionality of other modules. You’ll also create a new functionality of your own, including providing REST web services. We’ll finish by taking a brief look at how to create a mobile-friendly theme that ensures anybody on any device can take advantage of the amazing site we’ve built.
